Create a method that takes in a character array and outputs the same array with %20 int the place of spaces.


Question of the day: 
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (if you're doing this in java use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

Example:

Input: 
"Mr John Smith ", 13
Output: 
"Mr%20John%20Smith"
